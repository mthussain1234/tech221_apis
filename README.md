# APIs

## What are APIs?

APIs stand for application programming interfaces.
APIs are a way for 2 or more programs to communicate with each other, all the while using 
set definitions and protocols.

APIs make it easier for developers to create these complex applications by defining **how** these programs interact with
each other.

These different programs can share both data and functionality when they are connected with APIs.
Time and effort is saved by developers by using these APIs to make applications that use **pre-existing** code and services.

The reason why APIs are so popular, is because it is very quick and simple for developers to create **robust, feature-rich apps**.
In addition to this, there is no need to start from scratch as using APIs lets developers use outside services into their
own applications, allowing for new features and functionalities to be added.
